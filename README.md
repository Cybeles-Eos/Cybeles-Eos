### Hi there, Iâ€™m **Zach**ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Jr. Fullstack Developer who builds practical, efficient and user-focused web solutions. I work on both frontend and backend, combining clean code with clear design. I build minimalist interfaces that focus on clarity and function. I care about usability, speed and detail, making sure every project works smoothly and looks consistent across all platforms.
